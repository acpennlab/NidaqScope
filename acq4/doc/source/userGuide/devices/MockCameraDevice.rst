Simulated Camera
================

MockCamera is a simulated camera device that follows all of the conventions defined for :ref:`generic Camera devices <userDevicesCamera>`. Because it requires no imaging hardware, MockCamera is used for testing and demonstration purposes, and is included in ACQ4's example configuration.

MockCamera features:    

* Position-dependent procedural imagery (a Mandelbrot fractal). When combied with a mock microscope device, this allows to explore different parts of the imagery at multiple magnification levels. 
* Simulation of CCD noise including efects of exposure time and binning
* Simulated calcium indicator sources.
