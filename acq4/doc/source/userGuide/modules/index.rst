.. _userModules:

ACQ4's functionality is organized into several user interface modules. Each module provides tools for
interacting with data or devices in different ways. When ACQ4 first starts up, by default it displays
the Manager module window, from which it is possible to launch all other modules and also perform basic
device interactions.
