============

Although ACQ4 is a general-purpose acquisition system, it was designed with emphasis on a few specific experimental techniques. These techniques are described here with an overview of the hardware and software components required for each.


Electrophysiology
-----------------

Standard electrophysiological techniques are supported through several Device classes and user interface modules. 

* :ref:`userDevicesMultiClamp`
* :ref:`userDevicesAxoPatch`
* :ref:`userDevicesDAQGeneric`
* :ref:`userModulesPatch`
* :ref:`userModulesTaskRunner`


The use of multi-electrode arrays is not currently well-supported in ACQ4, but this is a likely path for future development.
