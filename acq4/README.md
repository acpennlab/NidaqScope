ACQ4
====

Neurophysiology acquisition and analysis for Python

ACQ4 is a platform for data acquisition, management, and analysis in neurophysiology
experiments, especially focusing on patch clamp electrophysiology, optogenetics, 
and related techniques. It is used both as a platform for developing customized
data acquisition tools and as an application that handles the most common
requirements in whole-cell recording, calcium imaging, and photostimulation.

ACQ4 is developed with support from the [Allen Institute for Brain Science](alleninstitute.org), [Sensapex Oy](sensapex.com), the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](unc.edu), and many other users around the world.
